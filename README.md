<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I use the wonderful [Unity Resource Pack][unity-url] when I play Minecraft.

Contributions seem to have slowed on the version of the pack for Minecraft 1.7.10. As I have been playing with this version of the game, I have made several contributions. They are contained here so that others may use them while CyanideX decides whether to include them in the pack.

## Using this pack

1. Download the pack [here][latest-release-url].
1. Place the downloaded `.zip` file in Minecraft's resourcepack folder.
1. Install this pack above Unity in Minecraft's resourcepack settings.

## Contributions

This pack includes the following:

- Backported versions of the hardened clay textures used in Unity for later versions of Minecraft ([Unity contribution](https://github.com/Unity-Resource-Pack/Unity/pull/276))
- A texture for Biomes O' Plenty Quick Sand ([Unity contribution](https://github.com/Unity-Resource-Pack/Unity/pull/275))
- A texture for Railcraft's creosote bucket ([Unity contribution](https://github.com/Unity-Resource-Pack/Unity/pull/277))

If changes are implemented in Unity, they will be removed from this pack.
